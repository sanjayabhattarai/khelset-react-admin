# Wicket Double Counting Bug Fix

## Problem Fixed ✅
**Issue**: When clicking the "Wicket" button, wickets were being counted twice in:
1. **Innings wicket count** (showing 2 wickets instead of 1) ✅ **FIXED**
2. **Bowler wicket count** (showing 2 wickets instead of 1) ✅ **FIXED**

## Root Cause
The wicket processing flow had two functions both incrementing wicket counts:

1. **`processEnhancedDelivery`** (in enhancedScoringUtils.ts) - correctly increments both:
   - `innings.wickets += 1` ✅
   - `currentBowler.wickets += 1` ✅
2. **`processWicket`** (in dismissalUtils.ts) - was also incrementing both:
   - `innings.wickets += 1` ❌ (double count!)
   - `innings.bowlingStats[bowlerIndex].wickets += 1` ❌ (double count!)

## The Bug Flow
```
User clicks "Wicket" button
↓
onWicket() → shows wicket modal
↓  
onWicketConfirm() → calls handleWicketConfirm()
↓
handleWicketConfirm() calls:
├── processEnhancedDelivery() → innings.wickets += 1, bowler.wickets += 1 ✅ (correct)
└── processWicket() → innings.wickets += 1, bowler.wickets += 1 ❌ (double count!)
```

## Solution Applied
**Fixed `dismissalUtils.ts`**: Removed both duplicate increments from `processWicket()` function.

```typescript
// BEFORE (causing double count):
innings.wickets += 1;
innings.bowlingStats[bowlerIndex].wickets += 1;

// AFTER (fixed):
// FIXED: Don't increment wickets here because processEnhancedDelivery already handles it
// This prevents double counting when wicket button is clicked
// innings.wickets += 1; // REMOVED - handled by processEnhancedDelivery
// bowler.wickets += 1; // REMOVED - handled by processEnhancedDelivery
```

## What This Fixes
- ✅ **Wicket button now correctly counts 1 wicket** (innings total)
- ✅ **Bowler wicket count is accurate** (1 wicket per dismissal, except run-outs)
- ✅ **All dismissal types work correctly** (bowled, caught, LBW, run out, etc.)
- ✅ **Run-out logic preserved** (bowler doesn't get credit for run-outs)
- ✅ **Free hit rules still work** (only run-outs count on free hits)
- ✅ **Innings ending conditions work properly**

## What Still Works
- ✅ **Run outs with runs completed**
- ✅ **Wicket selection modal** (batsman selection for run-outs)
- ✅ **Fielder credit for catches/stumpings**
- ✅ **All cricket scoring rules** remain intact
- ✅ **Undo functionality** works correctly

## Test Cases Verified
1. **Regular wicket (bowled)**: 1 innings wicket, 1 bowler wicket ✅
2. **Caught out**: 1 innings wicket, 1 bowler wicket, fielder credited ✅  
3. **Run out**: 1 innings wicket, 0 bowler wickets (correct) ✅
4. **LBW**: 1 innings wicket, 1 bowler wicket ✅
5. **Free hit + wicket**: No wickets counted (unless run out) ✅
6. **Wide + run out**: 1 innings wicket, 0 bowler wickets, runs added correctly ✅

## Files Changed
- `src/features/scoring/cricket/logic/dismissalUtils.ts` - Removed duplicate wicket increments for both innings and bowler

The cricket scoring system now counts wickets correctly! 🏏
