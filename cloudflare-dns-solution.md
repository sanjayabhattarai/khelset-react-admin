# Alternative Solution: Using Cloudflare for DNS Management

## Why Use Cloudflare?
- **Free DNS management** for any domain

## Setup Steps:

### Step 1: Create Cloudflare Account

### Step 2: Cloudflare Setup
1. Cloudflare will scan your existing DNS records
2. They'll provide you with **Cloudflare nameservers** (usually 2)
   - Example: `ns1.cloudflare.com` and `ns2.cloudflare.com`

### Step 3: Update Nameservers at Babal Host
1. Log into your Babal Host account
2. Find "Domain Management" or "Nameservers" section
3. **Replace Babal Host nameservers** with Cloudflare nameservers
4. Save changes (propagation takes 24-48 hours)

### Step 4: Configure DNS in Cloudflare
Once nameservers are active:
1. Go to Cloudflare DNS tab
2. Add CNAME record:
   - **Type**: CNAME
   - **Name**: admin
   - **Target**: khelset-new.web.app
   - **Proxy status**: DNS only (gray cloud)

## Benefits:

## What to Tell Babal Host:
"I want to use external DNS management (Cloudflare) while keeping my domain registered with you. I need to update the nameservers for khelset.com to point to Cloudflare's nameservers."
