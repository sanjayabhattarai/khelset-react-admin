# Response to Babal Host Support

**Subject**: DNS Record Configuration for External Hosting (Firebase) - Domain: khelset.com

---

**To**: Babal Host Support Team  
**From**: [Your Name]  
**Domain**: khelset.com  
**Date**: September 2, 2025

## Clarification of Requirements

Thank you for your response. I understand that subdomains are typically created through your hosting service, but I have a different setup that I'd like to clarify.

## My Current Situation

- ✅ **Domain Registration**: I have purchased the domain `khelset.com` from Babal Host
- ❌ **Web Hosting**: I do NOT have a web hosting plan with Babal Host
- ✅ **External Hosting**: I am using **Firebase Hosting** (Google's hosting service) for my web application

## What I Need

I need to configure DNS records to point my subdomain to an external hosting provider (Firebase), not to Babal Host's hosting servers.

**Specific DNS Record Needed:**
- **Type**: CNAME Record
- **Name/Host**: admin
- **Value/Points to**: khelset-new.web.app
- **TTL**: 3600

This will make `admin.khelset.com` point to my Firebase-hosted application.

## Questions for Babal Host

1. **Can I manage DNS records** for my domain through your control panel without purchasing hosting?

2. **Do you provide DNS management** for domain-only customers?

3. **Where can I access DNS settings** in my Babal Host account?

4. **Is there a fee** for DNS record management without hosting?

## Alternative Solutions (if DNS management not available)

If Babal Host doesn't provide DNS management for domain-only customers, I understand I have these options:

1. **Purchase minimal hosting plan** just for DNS access
2. **Transfer DNS management** to Cloudflare (free)
3. **Use external DNS service** while keeping domain registration with Babal Host

## What I DON'T Need

- Web hosting space/storage
- Email hosting
- Website builder tools
- Server management

## What I DO Need

- Ability to create DNS records (specifically CNAME)
- Point subdomain to external service (Firebase)

## Request

Could you please:

1. **Confirm if DNS management is available** for domain-only customers
2. **Provide access instructions** to DNS settings in my account
3. **Guide me through creating** the CNAME record mentioned above
4. **If not available**, recommend the most cost-effective solution

## Technical Context

This is for a professional cricket scoring web application hosted on Google Firebase. I only need DNS configuration to connect my purchased domain to the external hosting service.

Thank you for clarifying this setup!
