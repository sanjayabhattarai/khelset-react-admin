# Migration Guide: Enhanced Cricket Scoring Implementation

## üö® CRITICAL BUGS FIXED

### ‚úÖ **Critical Bug Fixes:**

1. **üö´ Double Wicket Counting Fixed**
   - Wickets are no longer counted twice (once on trigger, once on confirmation)
   - Wide/No-ball wicket flow properly separated from delivery processing
   - Cricket rule: One wicket = one dismissal only

2. **üèè Run-Out### Wicket Handling (Enhanced)
| Extra Type | Valid Wickets | Batsman Selection | Runs Counted | Bowler Wicket Credit | Free Hit Next? |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Wide | Run out only | Manual selection ‚úÖ | Yes ‚úÖ | No (run-out) ‚úÖ | No ‚úÖ |
| No-ball | Run out, Stumped | Manual selection ‚úÖ | Yes ‚úÖ | Run-out: No, Stumped: Yes ‚úÖ | Yes (preserved) ‚úÖ |
| Normal | All types | Automatic (on strike) | Yes ‚úÖ | Run-out: No, Others: Yes ‚úÖ | No ‚úÖ |
| **Run-out + completed runs** | **Run out** | **Manual selection** ‚úÖ | **Yes (batsman + bowler + team)** ‚úÖ | **No** ‚úÖ | **No** ‚úÖ |ts Don't Count Against Bowler**
   - Run-out wickets are never credited to bowler's statistics
   - This applies to all scenarios: wide, no-ball, normal delivery
   - Cricket rule: Run-outs are fielding dismissals, not bowling dismissals

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory Next Batsman Selection**
   - UI cannot proceed without selecting next batsman after wicket
   - NextBatsmanSelector has proper validation (confirm button disabled until selection)
   - Cricket rule: Match cannot continue without 2 batsmen on field

4. **üèÉ Runs Completed During Run-Out Properly Counted**
   - When run-out occurs with completed runs, those runs are credited properly
   - Runs go to: batsman account + bowler account + team score
   - Cricket rule: Runs completed before dismissal count in all accounts

## üö® CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### ‚úÖ **Must-Fix Issues Resolved:**

1. **üèè Bowler Protection from Fielding Errors**
   - Byes and leg-byes are NO LONGER charged to bowler's account
   - This applies even on no-balls (only penalty counts against bowler)
   - Cricket rule: Bowler should not be penalized for fielding/wicket-keeping errors

2. **üîÑ Accurate Strike Rotation**
   - Strike changes based on physical runs completed by batsmen
   - NOT based on total runs or runs credited to batsman
   - Cricket rule: Strike changes when batsmen cross odd number of times

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

### 1. Enhanced Components
- ‚úÖ **WideNoBallModal.tsx** - Now captures wicket type
- ‚úÖ **ScoringPanel.tsx** - Updated to handle wicket type parameter
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced scoring logic** - Created `enhancedScoringUtils.ts`

### 2. Updated Core Logic

6. Confirm wicket

Expected Result:
- Score increases by 1 run
- 1 run charged to bowler and credited to on-strike batsman
- Strike changes (odd runs)
- Non-strike batsman is out (not the one who hit the ball)
- New batsman selector appears
```

#### Test Scenario 8: No-Ball + Byes (BOWLER PROTECTION)
```

- Strike changes (odd physical runs)
- Ball counts toward over
```

#### Test Scenario 10: Strike Rotation Verification
```
1. Click "WD" (Wide) button
2. Set additional runs to 1 (batsmen ran 1)
3. Don't check wicket
4. Confirm
5. Note which batsman is now on strike

Expected Result:
- Strike changes because batsmen physically ran 1 (odd)
- Verify the batsman who was non-strike is now on strike
```

#### Test Scenario 11: Run-Out Wicket - No Bowler Credit (BUG FIX)
```
1. Click normal scoring button (e.g., "2")
2. Click "Wicket" button
3. In WicketModal: Select "Run Out"
4. Select any batsman, set runs completed: 1, select fielder
5. Confirm wicket
6. Check bowler's wicket count in UI

Expected Result:
- Score increases by 2 runs
- 2 runs charged to bowler (for the delivery)

- Mandatory next batsman selection appears
```

#### Test Scenario 13: Next Batsman Selection Mandatory (BUG FIX)
```
1. Get any batsman out (use any method)
2. In NextBatsmanSelector, try to proceed without selecting
3. Try clicking confirm without selection

Expected Result:
- Confirm button is disabled until batsman selected
- Cannot proceed to scoring until valid selection made
- UI properly blocks progression without selection
```

#### Test Scenario 14: Run-Out with Completed Runs (BUG FIX)
```
1. Click normal scoring button (e.g., "2")
2. Click "Wicket" button
3. In WicketModal: Select "Run Out"
4. Select the on-strike batsman as the one who got out
5. Set runs completed: 1, select fielder
6. Confirm wicket
7. Check all accounts (batsman, bowler, team score)

Expected Result:
- Team score increases by 2 runs (initial hit) + 1 run (completed before run-out) = 3 total
- On-strike batsman gets 2+1 = 3 runs credited
- Bowler gets charged 2+1 = 3 runs
- Bowler's WICKET count does NOT increase (run-out)
- Innings wicket count increases by 1
- Strike changes based on total odd runs (3)
- Delivery logged with proper run attribution
```

### Automated Testing

~~Run the test scenarios in the browser console:~~ **REMOVED - Test files cleaned up**

```javascript
// DEPRECATED: Test files have been removed after bug fixes were verified
// Manual testing using the scenarios below is now sufficient
```

## üêõ Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: TypeScript Errors
**Problem**: Type mismatches in component props
**Solution**: Make sure all components using `onDelivery` have updated signatures

### Issue 2: Firestore Undefined Values Error
**Problem**: `FirebaseError: Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined`
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Updated delivery logging to avoid undefined values in wicketInfo
```typescript
// Fixed in useMatchData.ts - now builds wicketInfo conditionally
const wicketInfo = result.isWicketFallen && wicketType ? {
  type: wicketType,
  batsmanId: matchData.onStrikeBatsmanId!,
  // fielderId only added when actually available
} : null;
```

### Issue 3: State Not Updating
**Problem**: UI doesn't reflect scoring changes
**Solution**: Check that Firestore rules allow updates and data is syncing

### Issue 4: Strike Not Changing Correctly
**Problem**: Strike rotation happens at wrong times
**Solution**: Verify that strike changes on odd `runs` parameter (batsmen runs), not total runs

### Issue 5: Free Hit Not Working
**Problem**: Free hit not triggered after no-ball
**Solution**: Check that `isFreeHit` flag is set correctly in enhanced logic

## üîÑ Gradual Migration Strategy

If you encounter issues, you can migrate gradually:

### Phase 1: Side-by-side testing
```typescript
// In useMatchData.ts, temporarily use both functions
const resultOld = processDelivery(matchData, params);
const resultNew = processEnhancedDelivery(matchData, params);

// Compare results and log differences
console.log('Old vs New Results:', { resultOld, resultNew });

// Use old logic while testing
return resultOld;
```

### Phase 2: Feature flag approach
```typescript
const USE_ENHANCED_SCORING = true; // Toggle for testing

const result = USE_ENHANCED_SCORING 
  ? processEnhancedDelivery(matchData, params)
  : processDelivery(matchData, params);
```

### Phase 3: Full migration
Once testing is complete, remove old logic and use only `processEnhancedDelivery`.

## üìù Key Differences in Enhanced Logic

### Run Attribution (Enhanced)
| Scenario | Batsman Account | Extras Account | Bowler Account | Strike Change |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Wide + 2 runs | 0 runs | 3 runs (1+2) | 1 run (penalty only) ‚úÖ | Yes (odd physical runs) ‚úÖ |
| No-ball + hit 4 | 4 runs | 1 run (penalty) | 5 runs (penalty+hit) ‚úÖ | No (boundary) ‚úÖ |
| No-ball + 2 byes | 0 runs | 3 runs (1+2) | 1 run (penalty only) ‚úÖ | Yes (odd physical runs) ‚úÖ |
| No-ball + 2 leg-byes | 0 runs | 3 runs (1+2) | 1 run (penalty only) ‚úÖ | Yes (odd physical runs) ‚úÖ |
| Normal + 3 byes | 0 runs | 3 runs | 0 runs (fielding error) ‚úÖ | Yes (odd physical runs) ‚úÖ |
| Normal + 1 leg-bye | 0 runs | 1 run | 0 runs (batting error) ‚úÖ | Yes (odd physical runs) ‚úÖ |
| **Run-out + 1 run completed** | **1 run** ‚úÖ | **0 runs** | **1 run** ‚úÖ | **Yes (odd runs)** ‚úÖ |

### Wicket Handling (Enhanced)
| Extra Type | Valid Wickets | Batsman Selection | Runs Counted | Free Hit Next? |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Wide | Run out only | Manual selection ‚úì | Yes ‚úì | No ‚úì |
| No-ball | Run out, Stumped | Manual selection ‚úì | Yes ‚úì | Yes (preserved) ‚úì |
| Normal | All types | Automatic (on strike) | Yes ‚úì | No ‚úì |

### Strike Rotation
| Scenario | Old Logic | Enhanced Logic |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Wide + 1 run | No change | Changes ‚úì |
| No-ball + hit 4 | No change | No change ‚úì |
| Bye + 3 runs | Changes | Changes ‚úì |

### Ball Counting
| Extra Type | Counts as Ball? | Free Hit Next? |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Wide | No ‚úì | No ‚úì |
| No-ball | No ‚úì | Yes ‚úì |
| Bye | Yes ‚úì | No ‚úì |
| Leg-bye | Yes ‚úì | No ‚úì |

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your implementation is working correctly when:

1. ‚úÖ **Run attribution** matches cricket rules
2. ‚úÖ **Strike rotation** happens only on odd physical runs by batsmen
3. ‚úÖ **Ball counting** follows proper cricket rules
4. ‚úÖ **Free hits** work after no-balls
5. ‚úÖ **Wickets** are properly tracked with types
6. ‚úÖ **UI updates** reflect all changes accurately
7. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL: Byes/leg-byes never charged to bowler** (even on no-ball)
8. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL: Strike changes based on physical runs, not credited runs**
9. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL: No double wicket counting (delivery + confirmation)**
10. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL: Run-out wickets never credited to bowler**
11. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL: Next batsman selection is mandatory after wickets**
12. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL: Runs completed during run-out properly attributed to all accounts**

## üöÄ Next Enhancements

Once the core logic is working, consider these improvements:

1. **Better error handling** in delivery processing
2. **Undo functionality** for complex deliveries
3. **Commentary generation** based on delivery type
4. **Statistics tracking** for different extra types
5. **Match analytics** with enhanced run breakdowns

## üÜò Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify Firestore data** is updating correctly
3. **Test individual functions** using the test scenarios
4. **Compare results** between old and new logic
5. **Check component prop passing** through the chain

### üî• Common Firestore Errors

**Error**: `Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined`
**Cause**: Trying to save `undefined` values to Firestore
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Fixed in this implementation - all delivery data now properly handles optional fields

**Error**: `Missing or insufficient permissions`
**Cause**: Firestore security rules blocking writes
**Solution**: Check your Firestore rules allow authenticated users to write to matches collection

### üêõ Debugging Tips

1. **Use browser dev tools** to inspect network requests
2. **Check Firestore console** to see if data is being written
3. **Add console.logs** in delivery processing to trace data flow
4. **Test with simple scenarios** first (normal deliveries) before complex ones

The enhanced system provides much more accurate cricket scoring that follows real cricket rules!
